- **Be clear**: Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon when possible
- **Be respectful**: Disagree respectfully and focus on ideas, not people

#### Code Reviews

- **Be professional**: Maintain a professional tone even when providing critical feedback

## Responsibilities

### Project Maintainers

**Project maintainers are responsible for:**

- **Enforcing the code**: Responding appropriately to any unacceptable behavior
- **Leading by example**: Demonstrating positive and inclusive behavior
- **Creating a safe environment**: Ensuring the community remains welcoming and respectful
- **Providing support**: Helping community members understand and follow these guidelines

### Enforcement Process

**When violations occur:**

1. **Initial Contact**: A maintainer will contact the individual privately to discuss the issue
2. **Warning**: If the behavior continues, a formal warning may be issued
3. **Temporary Consequences**: Temporary suspension from community participation may be applied
4. **Permanent Consequences**: For severe or repeated violations, permanent ban may be issued

**Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:**

- **Remove, edit, or reject**: Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- **Temporarily or permanently ban**: Any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

### Reporting Guidelines

**How to report unacceptable behavior:**

- **Email**: conduct@kset.dev
- **Private Message**: Contact any maintainer privately via GitHub
- **Issue Report**: Create a private issue with the "conduct" label

**What to include in your report:**

- **Specific details**: Describe the incident with as much detail as possible
- **Context**: Provide relevant context about when and where it occurred
- **Impact**: Explain how the behavior affected you or others
- **Evidence**: Include screenshots, links, or other evidence if available
- **Desired outcome**: What resolution would be satisfactory to you?

**Confidentiality:** All reports will be handled confidentially and with sensitivity to the reporter's privacy.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- **All community spaces**: Including GitHub repositories, Discord servers, social media, and events
- **All community members**: Contributors, maintainers, and users of the project
- **Both public and private interactions**: Online and offline interactions related to the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement Philosophy

### Our Approach

We believe in:

- **Education over punishment**: We prefer to educate and guide rather than punish
- **Restorative justice**: Focus on repairing harm and restoring relationships when possible
- **Proportionate response**: Consequences should be appropriate to the severity of the violation
- **Due process**: Individuals should have an opportunity to respond to allegations

### Decision Making

**Enforcement decisions will be based on:**

- **Impact on the community**: How the behavior affects the community's health and inclusivity
- **Intent and context**: Whether the behavior was intentional and the circumstances surrounding it
- **Pattern of behavior**: Whether this is an isolated incident or part of a pattern
- **Response to feedback**: How the individual responds when the behavior is addressed

## Appeal Process

If you believe a decision was made in error:

1. **Submit appeal**: Email conduct@kset.dev with "Appeal" in the subject line
2. **Provide context**: Explain why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. **Include evidence**: Provide any relevant evidence or context
4. **Request review**: Ask for a review by a different maintainer or the entire maintainer team

**Timeline:** Appeals will be reviewed within 7 days, and a response will be provided.

## Cultural Considerations

### Global Community

KSET serves a global community, including many Korean speakers. We acknowledge that:

- **Language barriers**: Misunderstandings can occur due to language differences
- **Cultural differences**: Communication styles vary across cultures
- **Translation issues**: Automatic translations may not always convey intended meaning

### Guidelines for Cross-Cultural Communication

- **Assume good intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt
- **Ask for clarification**: If something is unclear, ask politely for explanation
- **Be patient with language differences**: Allow time for translation and understanding
- **Use simple language**: Avoid complex idioms or cultural references that may not translate well
- **Provide translations**: When possible, provide translations for important communications

### Korean Community Guidelines

For our Korean-speaking community members:

- **Both Korean and English are welcome**: Use whichever language you're most comfortable with
- **Translation assistance**: We'll try to provide translations for important communications
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Be mindful of Korean business and communication customs
- **Time zone awareness**: Remember that many community members are in different time zones

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreements

Healthy disagreement is normal and can lead to better outcomes. When disagreements arise:

1. **Stay focused on the issue**: Avoid personal attacks or assumptions about motives
2. **Listen to understand**: Make an effort to understand others' perspectives
3. **Find common ground**: Look for areas of agreement and build from there
3. **Seek mediation**: If needed, ask a maintainer to help mediate the discussion

### Escalation

If a disagreement cannot be resolved directly:

1. **Involve a maintainer**: Ask a maintainer to help facilitate the discussion
2. **Private discussion**: Move to a private channel if the discussion is becoming disruptive
3. **Time out**: Take a break from the discussion if emotions are running high
4. **Formal mediation**: For serious conflicts, request formal mediation from the maintainer team

## Professional Conduct

- **Professional communication**: Maintain professional standards in all interactions
- **Regulatory awareness**: Be mindful of financial regulations and compliance requirements
